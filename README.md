## Description/Summary
NoteTracker is a to-do list app that allows users to take control of their schedules. Users can create accounts and save as many to-do lists as they wish to keep track of different projects simultaneously.

You can start using the app by registering a new user account. Click "Register" at the top of the app's page and follow the instructions. After that, you'll be taken to the Login screen and you can begin creating to-do lists.

Users can add and edit tasks they add to each list, and both can be deleted at any time.
